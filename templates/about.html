        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hey, I'm Trevor Farias, an aspiring software / hardware engineer. I am currently a second-year Computer Engineering student at Queens University in Ontario. 
        </p>
        <p>
        My passion for everything technology started when I got my first shared-2DS in 2013. As a kid, video games were my creative outlet, leading me to create and manage Minecraft servers. I created custom plugins using Java and C, while also delving into network management, using tools like Wireshark and Burp Suite. I was the sole developer, while also maintaining a player-base. I was challenged with the difficult balance of making sure my community was happy, while also creating fun and innovative updates. Through this experience, I realized the significance of the social aspect that lies beyond programming.
        </p> 
         <p>
        Recently, my focus has shifted toward cybersecurity. I've been exploring various  platforms, such as Hackthebox, Hackthissite and TryHackMe. I created a linux clone on VMHardware and have been running most of my software and attempts through this.
        </p>
