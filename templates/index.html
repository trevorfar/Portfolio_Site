    <p>Hey, I'm Trevor Farias, an aspiring software / hardware engineer, originally from Salt Spring Island, BC. I am currently a second-year Computer Engineering student at Queens University in Ontario, but my passion for everything technology started when I got my first shared-2DS in 2013. Ever since, anything and everything digital has been my lifeline.

    As a kid, video games were my creative outlet, leading me to create and manage Minecraft servers. I created custom plugins using Java and C, while also delving into network management, using tools like Wireshark and Burp Suite. I was the sole developer, while also maintaining a player-base, which turned out to be a lot harder than I could have imagined. Through this experience, I started to realize that the programs I create are ultimately used by humans, emphasizing the significance of the social aspect beyond just programming. I was challenged with the difficult balance of making sure my community was happy, while also creating innovative and new updates.

    Recently, my focus has shifted toward cybersecurity. I've been exploring various  platforms, such as Hackthebox, Hackthissite and TryHackMe. I created a linux clone on VMHardware and have been running most of my software and attempts through this.
