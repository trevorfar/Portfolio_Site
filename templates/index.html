        Hello! 
        </p>    
        <p>
        For many years I've had an interest in website development, so I created this site to enhance my proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming and databases. This platform serves as a repository for a collection of my web-compatible projects, while also functioning as a practical learning ground.
        </p> 
        <p>
        I used languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, with the site's backend being structured on the Flask framework with SQL employed for database management. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Currently, the database is integrated solely with my calculator app, but I have many ideas for the future, most of which require a strong database. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Stay tuned for future updates and additions to this project.
        </p>
